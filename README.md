- **Gold accent color** (`#D4A843`) as a recurring motif for highlights and achievements
- **Split-screen layouts** to visually represent the duality of engineering & karate
- **Typography hierarchy** using Playfair Display for titles and Outfit for body text
- **Subtle motion** via CSS animations and canvas particles to create a living, breathing experience
